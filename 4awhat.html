<h2>IV. What readers and viewers see</h2>
	The growth of the Internet has brought as many changes for those who read the news as it has for those who produce it.  Readers can choose to have news delivered by several news providers via print, radio, television, the World Wide Web, e-mail, or cellular phones.  However, evidence shows that readers are not necessarily seeing a greater breadth of information, whether through the inability of news providers to offer it or their own choices.  News organizations are finding it difficult to stand out in a new marketplace, and readers may find it difficult to understand their options for finding reliable information.
