<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>The Changing Face of
News in the Information Age</strong></font></p>

<p>News providers serve several interests and fill several roles,
from a king's town crier to a partisan newspaper to a
profit-oriented broadcaster. In the media of 2000, the term
&quot;news provider&quot; can describe all sorts of people: a
traditional newspaper or television journalist, a Web site
manager, a talk-show host, and any citizen dedicated to
disseminating news and commentary through the Internet. With
today's technology &#151; satellite technology, desktop publishing
tools, and the Internet &#151; providers need not be part of
well-financed companies, and consumers have more choices.</p>

<p>The tools of new media promise to give society greater
capacity to communicate. However, the advances in technology and
expanded competition pose several challenges for news providers: </p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>A fast pace.</strong> With the Internet and
        24-hour news networks providing instant relay of news,
        any news provider seeking to report the news before the
        competition must do so very quickly. Some newspapers have
        instituted a &quot;24-hour newsroom,&quot; in which
        reporters, who once wrote stories only for the next
        morning's paper, may now be called upon to write stories
        at any time. Reporters may be tempted to sacrifice
        accuracy for speed, cutting back on the fact-checking
        process to get the story on the air or on the Internet.
        Also, reporters may not have the time to analyze an event
        and establish context, focusing instead on basic facts
        and reporting complex issues only in terms of simple
        political conflict.</li>
    <li><strong>Intense competition.</strong> News providers may
        be tempted to mislead readers to make the news seem more
        dramatic. Staking a claim to credibility can be
        difficult; with so many news providers claiming to tell
        the truth, how can any one gain the trust of readers and
        viewers?</li>
    <li><strong>The end of the traditional media's exclusive
        access to public records.</strong> Governments and
        candidates can publish all official materials on the Web,
        circumventing the reporters who have traditionally served
        as a filter. Newspapers may be losing the traditional
        role as &quot;papers of record&quot; for their
        communities, giving them the freedom to pass up the
        routine stories of community life and perhaps take a more
        aggressive and adversarial tone.</li>
    <li><strong>Fragmentation of audience.</strong> Readers and
        viewers have overwhelming choices now, and they seek the
        medium that is most comfortable or most entertaining: a
        neighborhood newspaper instead of the metro daily, a
        customized news page of soccer scores and entertainment
        listing instead of the New York Times' A section, a
        late-night talk show host instead of CNN's nightly fare,
        etc. Journalists have long attempted to hold a
        &quot;mirror to the world&quot;; today, people can choose
        to see their own reflections instead.</li>
    <li><strong>Changing professional standards.</strong>
        Newspapers and TV news operations have long-standing
        practices and processes full of checks and balances
        between reporters and editors. Today, individuals have
        the power to disseminate news without these checks and
        balances. Web sites and new cable channels may not have
        these traditional practices, or they may choose to
        challenge them by going in a different direction. Without
        the traditional checks and balances, news providers can
        lose credibility, and news consumers can be left
        wondering whom to trust.</li>
</ul>

<p>As these issues show, today's news providers, both traditional
and non-traditional, are in the process of inventing or
reinventing themselves in the face of changing technological and
institutional contexts. I plan to explore this process in my
final project by asking news providers and media critics to
discuss my central concerns: <font color="#800040"><strong>What
are the missions of news providers today?</strong></font> For
long-established news providers, how have these missions changed?
Do they find new pressures affecting their work, and if so, how
do they respond? Are newcomers and non-traditional news providers
trying to fill a traditional role? In addition to considering the
changing role of news providers, I will also consider how the
news industry is responding and adapting to the challenges
discussed above.</p>

<p>In order to fully explore my topic, I will interview a range
of subjects who represent the diversity of today's media.
Experienced journalists with traditional news providers can
describe the changes they've seen in their field over two
decades. However, younger journalists also may describe change
because change has come so rapidly, and the Internet, which was a
mere novelty when they started college, may have lured many into
a field in which they had little prior interest. Also, as the
recently proposed merger of AOL and Time Warner shows, the worlds
of traditional media and new media are colliding, and it will
soon be irrelevant to treat them as separate entities. Finally,
some news providers, such as late-night talk show hosts, may
claim that they do not intend to be news providers, even if
opinion polls show that they indeed serve this role for much of
the public.</p>

<p>Already, I have read extensively in this field, throughout the
MALS program and in my personal reading. I am currently employed
at USA TODAY's Web site, I have worked as a journalist for eight
years, and I keep myself updated on current issues in my field.
In the MALS program, I have compared the media corporations'
business strategies, compared subjective and objective approaches
in oral history, examined American and British culture through
letters to the editor, and studied the wildly partisan newspapers
of early American history. Finally, in my independent study with
Susan Tifft, I have studied the history of American journalism to
trace the notion of objectivity through time.</p>

<p>My background in these issues will help me prepare for my
interviews and the analysis and synthesis of the interview
transcripts and my ongoing reading. Through my historical and
cultural studies, I have examined the traits of individualism
that propel Americans to use media for self-expression. Through
my work and media studies, I have examined the process of
gathering and distributing information, comparing several systems
and approaches.</p>

<p>I also have seen firsthand the importance of the issues I'm
describing here. Today's tools give news providers great power to
inform or misinform. My final project, which will synthesize my
studies, will attempt to show how the news industry is using this
power.</p>
