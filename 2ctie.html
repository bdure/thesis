<h3>Analysis; &quot;tying together threads&quot;</h3>
	Filtering for readers requires analytical skills that also help reporters and editors add value to news stories.  In writing their stories, reporters sort through raw information and present it in a form that shows why the information is important.  A newspaper editor said that the value of this service has not changed in recent years: &quot;Readers still want someone to tie together the threads, look at larger issues that are raised by campaigns and probe beneath the surface.&quot; <font style="font: bold xx-small Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: super;"><a href="javascript:setContent(1)">1</a></font><p>
	One way these threads are tied together is by putting the information in context, providing background material to explain what is being reported.  &quot;There is no point to a story that has no context,&quot; said the same newspaper editor.  &quot;You must tell readers 'what this means to me.'&quot; <font style="font: bold xx-small Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: super;"><a href="javascript:setContent(2)">2</a></font><p>
	The television reporter added specific questions that he must answer for viewers: &quot;Wasn't this agency in trouble a month ago for failing to oversee how a non-profit spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars. Why did it happen again? Who was responsible the last time and was he/she responsible this time?&quot; <font style="font: bold xx-small Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: super;"><a href="javascript:setContent(3)">3</a></font>
