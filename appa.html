<h3>Appendix A. The questionnaires</h3>
	With one exception, the journalists were asked the following questions:<p>
 FIRST: A quick background question. What do you do now, and what is<p>
your past job experience? <p>
 1. What is your mission as a news provider? Has it changed? <p>
 2. Which of the following (you can pick more than one) describes your role and your company's role? Has this role changed in the past 5-15 years, and do you expect it to change in the next few years? Elaborate if necessary:	
<ul>
	<li>A &quot;mirror to the world,&quot; giving a complete picture of a community or the world</li>
	<li>A watchdog keeping an eye on institutions of power</li>
	<li>A beacon providing needed information to those who can't get it elsewhere</li>
	<li>An official public record</li>
	<li>A means of establishing truth</li>
	<li>An objective voice</li>
	<li>A filter to sort through a sea of information and give readers only the important things</li>
	<li>A conduit for people to decide for themselves what's important and what they want to know</li>
	<li>A source of entertainment </li>
</ul> 3. When you get information (from someone you've interviewed, from a public record you've read, from a story sent to you for editing or posting on the Web), is it your job to pass it on, or do you investigate it? <p>
 4. Do you have an editor? How many people see a news story or bit of information before it's published or posted? <p>
 5. Do you correct mistakes? How?<p>
 6. Which of the following tools do readers have to influence the news that you report?<p>
<ul>
	<li>Reader-submitted interview questions</li>
	<li>Customizable home pages</li>
	<li>Letters to the editor / e-mail</li>
	<li>Message boards</li>
	<li>Other</li>
</ul> 7. How important is it to give background and context in your stories?<p>
 8. Through the Internet and cable television, governments and candidates are better able to broadcast their own information without going through newspapers and TV newscasts. How has this affected your job? <p>
 9. Are you striving for objectivity? If so, which of the following definitions best fits your approach?<p>
<ul>
	<li>Getting both (or all) sides of a story</li>
	<li>Taking readers beyond the &quot;spin&quot; given by sources</li>
	<li>Reporting just the facts</li>
	<li>Giving priority to facts, but adding analysis</li>
	<li>Other </li>
</ul> 10. Who are your competitors, and what do you see as your strengths compared to them?  <p>
 11. How important is it to have the news before your competition? Do you find yourself with little time to check facts? Little time to give context? <p>
 12. Is the Internet a good tool to combat control of the media by a few conglomerates? <p>
 13. Do you have enough (newshole, programming time, space) to tell the news? Do you ever have too much? <p>
 14. How else has technology affected your work? What new pressures are affecting your work? How have you responded? <p>
 15. How do you think readers perceive you? What public perceptions of you and media in general would you like to change?<p>
	&quot;Web C,&quot; a media reporter, was asked a slightly modified version in which a few irrelevant questions were omitted and the wording changed so that his answers would reflect journalists as a whole rather than his own experience.<p>
	The journalists then were asked three follow-up questions:<p>
 1. Compare the breadth and depth of today's news coverage to the news coverage of five years ago, before 24-hour cable news networks multiplied and the Internet became a mainstream news source. <p>
 2. With many news organizations moving toward shorter news reports, is it more difficult to establish context? What can you do to establish context in shorter stories and briefs?<p>
 3.  Compared to five years ago, are you working with younger, less experienced people? If so, how has this trend affected your organization?<p>
	Only two participants, &quot;Web A&quot; and &quot;Web B,&quot; were able to respond to the follow-up questions in the allotted time.<p>
