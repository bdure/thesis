<font size="2">The Economist, &quot;Truth, Lies and Cyberspace,&quot; <i>The Economist</i>, April 24, 1999, p. 84.  The article listed three more notable hoaxes.  First, someone outside of Bloomberg's news organization posted a Web page designed to resemble a page in the Bloomberg Web site to that site.  Second, an e-mail passed around the Internet wrongly claimed that fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger had made a racist statement in an interview with talk-show host Oprah Winfrey.  Finally, another e-mail wrongly claimed that pop singer Mariah Carey, commenting in <i>USA TODAY</i> on the death of Jordan's King Hussein, had confused the king with basketball player Michael Jordan.
