<h3>Structure of the paper</h3>
	This paper will start by describing the service that journalists provide.  Section III will examine how this service is affected by the current technology-driven media climate.  Once I've described how this climate affects journalists, I'll describe in Section IV how the reader and viewer are affected.  The examination in Section IV will provide necessary background for an examination of the interview participants' answers, which will be given in Section V.  I can then come full circle and describe how journalists can respond, including a comparison of the participants' answers on general questions about their role.  Section VI will summarize what has been learned in this analysis, show how journalists' roles are changing, and suggest possible scenarios for their future roles.
