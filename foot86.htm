<font size="2">Howard.  As noted before, I was quoted in this section of the study.  Howard wrote: &quot;Beau Dure was formerly a journalist for the <i>News & Record</i> (Greensboro, NC) who later moved to the paper's Web site, The Depot, while working for the company. He found that matching skills to a job in new media is difficult, because of the ambiguity that comes with online publishing. Dure said: 'Every Web site is different. At some sites, &quot;producer&quot; means someone who slams stories into HTML and does little else. At other sites, they expect a producer to know advanced HTML, JavaScript, perhaps a little Perl, Photoshop, etc. And in some cases, &quot;producer&quot; really means &quot;editor,&quot; and it's possible that no technical skills whatsoever will be needed. And sadly, most employers don't know what skills they want and wouldn't know how to verify those skills even if they did.' &quot;
