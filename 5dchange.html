<h3>Changing with technology</h3>
	When asked how technology has affected their work, most participants expressed excitement over the research opportunities.  Other responses included:
<ul>
	<li>Web B: &quot;We are all technology.  It has created my job, and I think it's terrific.&quot;</li>
	<li>Newspaper A: &quot;We have to keep our eye on many more potential news sources than years ago mostly Internet sources and cable broadcast sources.&quot;</li>
	<li>TV A: &quot;Technology is just a tool.  You just have to be smart with how you use it, instead of letting it control you.&quot;</li>
	<li>TV B: &quot;The avalanche of technology has made me focus more on local, local, local.&quot;</li>
