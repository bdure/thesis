<h3>A &quot;safe, unconfusing environment&quot;</h3>
	Marketing professionals often speak of the importance of a &quot;brand.&quot;  In journalism, this term describes a news organization that presents news in a reliable, consistent manner.  Readers, viewers, and Web site users return to familiar news sources because they understand what they are getting and how to find the information they need.  &quot;Users get very impatient if they don't have a direct route to what they seek,&quot; said a Web site programmer. &quot;Our users look to us for a safe, un-confusing environment.&quot; <font style="font: bold xx-small Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: super;"><a href="javascript:setContent(1)">1</a></font><p>
