<font size="2">Newspaper Association of America, &quot;Newspaper Readership Remains Competitive in Top 50 Markets,&quot; available from <a href="http://www.naa.org/about/news/10_cmifall99.html" target="NEW">http://www.naa.org/about/news/10_cmifall99.html</a>; Internet. The study shows that among all Internet users in the top 50 markets, 61 percent read a daily newspaper on paper, and nearly three-quarters (74 percent) read one on Sunday.  Internet users who looked at online newspapers reported even higher numbers: 67 percent daily and 78 percent Sunday.  Even the Internet users who did not look at an online newspaper still reported higher-than-average print readership.
